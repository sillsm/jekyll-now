# Model CLA Policy and Rationale

[TOC]

## Introduction

Technology companies frequently receive and use code from outsiders; this
outside code may be important to core products. Outside code can be a tremendous
resource, but it also carries responsibility. This document spells out corporate
best practices for accepting code contributed by third parties and explains the
basis for these practices in agency law. These best practices consist of three
components: an Apache-type Contributor License Agreement (CLA), a procedure for
accepting CLA signatures, and a procedure for accepting code submitted under the
agreement.

This document will summarize the legal framework around code ownership, laying
out the rationale for employing an Apache-type CLA, and then discuss the
specific laws and operational concerns attendant to each part of the CLA signing
and code acceptance process.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
